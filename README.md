## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

```

## Getting Started

Create an environment for the app selecting to:

```
- Use TypeScript

```

Then go to the folder and install de default packages by runing:

`npm install`

To start the developer server:

`npm run dev`

To Visit the App:

`localhost:3000/`

Open `http://localhost:3000` with your browser to see the application live running.

## About the Project:

- src/app/page.tsx is the starting point of the application;
- You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
- This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
